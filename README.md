# Gifable Extension

A Firefox extension that allows you to connect with a self-hosted instance of [Gifable](https://github.com/pietvanzoen/gifable), the selfhosted alternative to Giphy or Tenor.

This extension allows you to query your Gifable instance for memes/gifs, and will automatically upload it to a running Element web instance.

## Setup

For now, install this extension as a manual extension.

1. Somewhere in your profile, clone down this repository:

   `git clone https://github.com/AgentScrubbles/gifable-extension`

2. In Firefox, go to `about:debugging` and then "Load Temporary Add-On"
3. Select the `manifest.json` to load the extension.

## Configuration

After installed, go to your extensions and click on the ðŸŒˆ for settings.

Add your Gifable URL, and API key.

- The api key can be found under Settings -> API Token in Gifable.

Click Save.

## Usage

In Element (currently the only supported app), you will see a new icon

![Rainbow icon next to the emoji button in Element](./readme_images/icon_location.png)

Clicking it will give the search bar to query your Gifable for images.

![Popover with query for images](./readme_images/query.png)

Click on any image and you will be prompted to Upload this image to Matrix

![Upload dialog for Matrix](./readme_images/upload.png)

Upload and you are finished!

# Future Items/Known Issues

- Currently the only way to close the dialog is to either select an image, or click on the tiny rainbow. I would like to also add the ESC key or clickout outside the dialog.
- Figuring out some way to share credentials for a Gifable instance based on what space you are in
- (Maybe) finding a way to union your Gifable instance with Tenor/Giphy
- Support for other clients
- Query for gifs anywhere on any site and simply display the URL to copy
